        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is RÃ©my, I am a Web Lover in Brussels and I focus myself on Front-end Development.</p>
        <p>Since my first years, I always enjoyed building things. I started developing my appetite for creation with Lego, continued with Minecraft and finally discovered Web development. It was a relief to find out what I really wanted to do as a living. I took full advantage of the motivation I had to start a long, difficult but passionate journey of learning front-end technologies as a self-taught.</p>
        <p>I now code everyday for a living and a hobby in Brussels with the powerful trio HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as some additional frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, Sass and jQuery.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I build projects as living and as a hobby. Here is a list of my favorites.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><Link href="/projects/memory">Memory</Link></li>
          <li><Link href="/projects/kpmg-careers">KPMG Careers</Link></li>
        </ul>
