I have been against TypeScript for a long time, because I thought I knew better and typing was a waste of time, only meant for distracted developers. I remember reading somewhere "TypeScript, once you go, you never go back". I guess it's obvious by now that it was all true. I am now a TypeScript advocate and we will see how to set it up in a Next.js project.

<blockquote>**TypeScript, once you go, you never go back**</blockquote>

Setting up TypeScript in a Next.js project is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps. This guide will first walk us through setting up TypeScript in a new Next.js project, which is a breeze. Secondly, we will see how adding TypeScript to an existing project works.

## Setting Up TypeScript in a New Next.js Project

1. Create a new Next.js project:

   Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

   `npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app --typescript`

   This command will create a new Next.js project with TypeScript already configured.

2. Navigate to our project directory:

   `cd my-nextjs-app`

3. Start the development server:

   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

4. Adapt TypeScript configuration:

   Next.js will automatically create a tsconfig.json file for us when we run the development server. This file will be generated in our project root.

   Check out an example of a tsconfig.json file in the next section.

Our new Next.js project with TypeScript is now up and running!

## Adding TypeScript to an Existing Next.js Project

1. Install TypeScript and necessary types: In our existing Next.js project, run the following command to install TypeScript and the necessary type definitions:

   `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node`

2. Create a tsconfig.json file: Next.js will automatically create a tsconfig.json file for us when we run the development server. Run the following command:

   `npm run dev`

   This will generate a tsconfig.json file in our project root.

3. Rename our files to TypeScript: Rename our JavaScript files (.js and .jsx) to TypeScript files (.ts and .tsx). For example:

   - pages/index.js -> index.tsx
   - components/MyComponent.js -> components/MyComponent.tsx

4. Fix any TypeScript errors: As we rename our files, we may encounter TypeScript errors. Address these errors by adding type annotations and fixing any issues that TypeScript identifies.

5. Update our tsconfig.json: We may want to customize our tsconfig.json file to suit our project's needs. Here is an example configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ES6",
       "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
       "allowJs": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true,
       "strict": false,
       "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
       "noEmit": true,
       "incremental": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "module": "esnext",
       "moduleResolution": "node",
       "resolveJsonModule": true,
       "isolatedModules": true,
       "jsx": "preserve"
     },
     "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
     "exclude": ["node_modules"]
   }
   ```

6. Optionnally, we can add paths to our tsconfig.json to make our imports cleaner:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       // ...
       "paths": {
         "@components/*": ["components/*"],
         "@hooks/*": ["hooks/*"],
         "@utils/*": ["utils/*"],
         "@types/*": ["types/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Here is an example import line using the paths:

   `import { Header } from '@components/header';`

7. Run the development server: Finally, we start our development server to ensure everything is working correctly:

   `npm run dev`

8. Additionnally, a good practice is to ensure build is not throwing any errors:

   `npm run build`

We are all set to code efficiently with the help of TypeScript. Should we want more automation power, we should consider <Linkk href="/blog/set-up-eslint-into-nextjs">adding ESLint and Prettier to our project</Linkk>.

**TLDR**: <Linkk href="https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/setup-nextjs-typescript-mn8cd3">Codesandbox: Set up Next.js with TypeScript</Linkk>.

Since Next.js is moving fast, we should keep an eye on the <Linkk href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/config/typescript">official Next.js TS documentation</Linkk> for TypeScript updates.

Enjoy coding with Next.js!
