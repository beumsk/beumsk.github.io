I do more and more JavaScript because of the usual requirements in projects, but I will always love a useful, adaptable and cross-browser working CSS trick.

I recently had to build an advanced header navigation and for some reasons it was easier not to use any JavaScript for this. Even though I knew for sure I could handle big screen layout and transitions with CSS only, I thought complexity would come with smaller devices and thus organizing the links differently.

I also wanted a single navigation in HTML to avoid duplication of code and a fair level of browser compatibility (by fair I mean no IE).

Without further ado, let's dive into a working solution for our case with a first step into the HTML. It's kept dead simple, except for the checkbox that we will understand later.

## The HTML structure for the navigation

```html
<header class="header">
  <!-- this checkbox handles the hide/show menu logic -->
  <input type="checkbox" class="header__burger" />

  <a href="https://remybeumier.be" target="_blank" class="header__logo">
    <img src="path" alt="alt" />
  </a>

  <div class="header__links">
    <a href="#0" class="header__link">Link with sublinks</a>
    <div class="header__sublinks">
      <a href="#0">Sublink</a>
      <a href="#0">Sublink</a>
      <a href="#0">Sublink</a>
      <a href="#0">Sublink</a>
      <a href="#0">Sublink</a>
    </div>
    <a href="#0" class="header__link">Link</a>
    <a href="#0" class="header__link">Link</a>
    <a href="#0" class="header__link">Link</a>
    <a href="#0" class="header__link">Link</a>
  </div>
</header>
```

If you don't risk any heart attack, you can check the result as of now. It will give you a 'wow' effect when we will add some styling; Actually, I still have that great feeling after many years of web development.

## Small screens header styling

Following a mobile first mindset, we will start with the SCSS from the tiniest screens.

```scss
.header {
  box-shadow: 0px 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: flex-start;
  background-color: white;

  .header__logo {
    display: flex;
    padding: 11px;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;
    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      background-color: #f5f5f5;
    }
    svg {
      min-width: 32px;
    }
  }

  .header__links {
    display: none;
    flex-direction: column;
    padding: 8px 0;
    border-top: solid 1px #e5e5e5;
    width: 100%;
  }

  .header__link {
    color: #333;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 8px 16px;
    white-space: nowrap;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out, color 0.3s ease-in-out;
    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      background-color: #f5fafb;
      color: #80d0c7;
    }
    &.active {
      background-color: #f5fafb;
    }
    + .header__sublinks {
      > a {
        display: block;
        padding: 4px 8px;
        margin-left: 16px;
        color: #55626a;
        font-size: 0.875rem;
        text-decoration: none;
        transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out, color 0.3s ease-in-out;
        &:hover,
        &:focus {
          color: #80d0c7;
          background-color: #f5fafb;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Regarding the code, I don't think it contains anything fancy. We use `position: sticky` because it is so easy for top nav, a bit of `flex` layout and transitions but that's it for this part.

## The CSS trick

Here is the gold of the article. We will see that we handle the toggle with the checkbox element and its `:checked` pseudo class. We also totally change its design to have a burger element.

```scss
.header__burger {
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 54px;
  height: 54px;
  margin: 0;
  appearance: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;
  &::after {
    content: '';
    height: 24px;
    width: 24px;
    top: 15px;
    left: 15px;
    position: absolute;
    background: linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      #80d0c7 20%,
      transparent 20% 40%,
      #80d0c7 40% 60%,
      transparent 60% 80%,
      #80d0c7 80% 100%
    );
  }
  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
  }
  &:checked {
    ~ .header__links {
      display: flex;
    }
  }
}
```

The first comment about this snippet will be about the design of the checkbox. As you can see, we removed its default with `appearance: none` and we applied a gradient as background to mimic a burger menu. I could have avoided the `::after`, but I liked the idea to have a bigger click area. Of course, we could change this to an icon font, or a label pointing to the checkbox giving us a lot more possibilities.

And secondly, we handle the show/hide logic. We are looking for the checkbox to be `:checked` <Linkk href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_checked">Browser compatibility on caniuse</Linkk>, and we select the `.header__links` among its sibling with the `~` selector. As of now, we can nicely toggle the menu on or off without JavaScript.

> Some could argue a burger menu is not so user-friendly. I think given how widely it's used, a user will understand directly what it is and how to use it.

## Big screens header styling

I know it's not the core content of the article, but let's design our navigation completely and give it a nice look on desktops too.

```scss
@media only screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;

  .header__links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    padding: 0;
    border-top: none;
    width: auto;
  }

  .header__link {
    display: inline-flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    height: 54px;
    padding: 9px 10px;
    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      + .header__sublinks {
        height: 42px;
      }
    }

    + .header__sublinks {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      position: absolute;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      top: 54px;
      height: 0;
      overflow: hidden;
      background-color: #f5fafb;
      border-top: solid 1px #e5e5e5;
      transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;
      > a {
        padding: 10px;
        margin-left: 0;
        color: #333;
        font-size: 1rem;
      }
      &:hover,
      &:focus-within {
        height: 42px;
      }
    }
  }

  .header__burger {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

There isn't much magic in those lines. We are hiding the burger checkbox and are giving the navbar a horizontal layout to be able to display every link nicely. The only challenge was to design the sublinks in a catchy way. By default we give that sub navigation `height: 0` and once we hover its parent link, we adjust the height with a smooth transition.
