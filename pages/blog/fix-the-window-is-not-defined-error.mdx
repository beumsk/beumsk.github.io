import BlogLayout from '@components/blogLayout';

Next.js is very useful in many aspects, but nothing is perfect. One difficult point is the use of the `window` object. It is used in many libraries and tools such as analytics and, because Next.js uses pre-rendering, the window may be undefined and may therefore break our site.

## Wait for window to be ready

This is the usual fix we find for this issue. Somehow it was never the fitting solution in my projects, but I still try it every time.

```js
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  // Client-side-only code
}
```

## With useEffect

The other solution requires a better knowledge of React, using the `useEffect` hook. It is working because this hook will wait for the mounting of the page. Pay attention to the empty array, which is needed to work.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Client-side-only code
}, []);
```

For a working example, check [this article on dark mode](/blog/nextjs-dark-mode).

Enjoy coding with Next.js!

export default ({ children }) => <BlogLayout>{children}</BlogLayout>;
