It is advised and a good practice to define the language of a site. It's very straightforward in plain HTML, but it isn't so intuitive in Next.js. Let's see how we can do it.

## Static Site Generation

In Next.js, if we want to modify the `<head>` we import Head from next/Head, but what if we want to pass a property to the `<html>` tag? Next provides an option to add another JS file — in the pages folder — called `_document.js` allowing us to be in control of the upper HTML.

Here is the default content of it:

```js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

Make sure the above `_document.js` is in the pages folder.
We can now add the `lang` property on HTML `<html lang="en">` and have the language defined for our website.

## Server Side Rendering

If our site works with SSR, we can use another solution.
In `next.config.js` at the root of our project, define the following `i18n` object:

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en'],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
  },
};
```

Note this solution only works in Next.js version 10 and newer.

Enjoy coding with Next.js!

export default ({ children }) => <BlogLayout>{children}</BlogLayout>;
