## TODO

- test safari, mobile
- create real blog posts (next.js basics, darkmode, dev.to)
- save time machine when bee/eli paris goes live
- decide for analytics: https://www.goatcounter.com/ (doesn't need policy -> need a way to work in nextjs !!)
- improve perf (caching)
- add more images of features/pages?
- add project filter and order
- metrics animation? Number of projects/sites/hours/languages
- improve cv (rethink projects and articles sections)
- low res images (automate without next-optimized-images)
- improve resume with react features (mapping)
