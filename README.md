## DEPLOY

Ensure you updated the sitemap with `npm run sitemap` or `yarn sitemap`

Also make sure your linter is error-free with `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`

Deployment should be managed by the pipeline (`npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`)

Commit and Push your changes to master.
This will trigger Github Action and deploy the changes to gh-pages.

## TODO

- add new projects (todolist?)
- review images (avoid bg-img, use different resolutions: https://dev.to/builderio/optimal-images-in-html-5bg9)
- review design: https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/

1.4
- rework sitemap: basing on modified date of item is wrong with github pipeline -> use real dates
- metrics animation? Number of projects/sites/hours/languages/experience/soft-skills
- back to top button

X.X
- trailing slash urls not working (issue with github)
- add more images of features/pages?
- low res images (automate without next-optimized-images)
- rethink scss structure (BEM?)

Blog posts
- use prism in your nextjs markdown (+scss)
- css posts: dropdown, input with label animation
- use mdx with nextjs
- local ssg site with python
- props to parent/child
- md to html
- SSG vs SSR
