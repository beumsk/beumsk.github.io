One difficult point is the use of the <code>window</code> object. It is used in many libraries and tools such as analytics and, because Next.js uses pre-rendering, the window may be undefined and may therefore break our site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wait-for-window-to-be-ready\">Wait for window to be ready</h2>\n<p>This is the usual fix we find for this issue. Somehow it was never the fitting solution in my projects, but I still try it every time.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">if (typeof window !== &quot;undefined&quot;) {\n  // Client-side-only code\n}</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"with-useeffect\">With useEffect</h2>\n<p>The other solution requires a better knowledge of React, using the <code>useEffect</code> hook. It is working because this hook will wait for the mounting of the page. Pay attention to the empty array, which is needed to work.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    // Client-side-only code\n}, [])</code></pre>\n<p>For a working example, check <a href=\"/blog/nextjs-dark-mode\">this article on dark mode</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy coding with Next.js!</p>\n","date":"01/22/2022","categories":"next.js, tutorial"},"title":"Fix the Window is not defined error","description":"How to fix the error Window is not defined in Next.js","img":"/images/posts/fix-the-window-is-not-defined-error.jpg","url":"https://remybeumier.be/blog/fix-the-window-is-not-defined-error"},"__N_SSG":true}
